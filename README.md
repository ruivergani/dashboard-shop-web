## üíª About

In this challenge, you will develop an application that will use the GitHub API to search for issues from a repository, data from your profile and display them as a blog.

- Listing of your profile with image, number of followers, name and other information available via the GitHub API.

Although there are few features, you will need to remember concepts such as:

- Fetch/Axios
- Routing and React Router DOM
- Forms

To complete this challenge you will need to make some preparations and mainly do some research to understand the GitHub API.
